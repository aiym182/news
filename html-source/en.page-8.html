                  As the largest arboretum in Asia, visitors can enjoy the
                  beauty of native flowers and relax in the forest of
                  Baekdudaegan with 39 exhibition gardens. More than 500,000
                  wild loosestrifes are planted on the wild flower hill and form
                  a beautiful pink garden that visitors can enjoy. People also
                  can take the picture of a lifetime with the overwhelming huge
                  tiger air sculpture and the mountain grandpa who protects
                  Baekdudaegan in the photo zone. A variety of special
                  exhibitions that can only be seen in the arboretum, a ‘Forest
                  Flea Market’ created with local small business owners, a

                  experience zone where everyone of all ages can enjoy are
                  prepared. Let’s get away from everyday life and participate in
                  various forest vacation programs where you can feel a real
                  rest in the arms of the Baekdudaegan.

                  Importantly, the Bonja Festival is an ESG(Environmental,
                  Social, and Governance) festival that cares about the
                  environment. It aims an eco-friendly festival that minimizes
                  waste. All banners decorated at the festival are collected and
                  reborn as a gardening apron. In addition, opportunities for
                  sustainable income generation through contract cultivation
                  (420,000 plants) are provided for 31 farmers in the Bonghaw
                  area to enhance financial independence and strive for balanced
                  regional development.

                  The event period is the same as the BongHaw Sweetish Festival,
                  the well-known festival of Bonghaw-gun, which will be held
                  from July 30th. We recommend that you leave the bustling city
                  and go on a summer vacation to Bonghaw-gun, Korea’s iconic
                  clean mountain village.
