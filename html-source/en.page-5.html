                  Found out the germination characteristics of the seeds of
                  Penthorum chinense  (known as octopus legs in Korea), a rare
                  plant native to the Korean Peninsula.

                  The Octopus leg, which blooms in July and August, forms a
                  raceme which as its name suggests, develops with the end of
                  the stem splitting in all directions like octopus legs.They
                  are plants growing near moist streams and rivers but have
                  recently been on the verge of extinction due to the reduction
                  of natural wetlands due to wetland landfills. Octopus legs are
                  vulnerable to competition within the ecosystem. If there are
                  other plants around, they often don’t seem to grow properly.
                  However, due to their unusual survival strategies, they have
                  been able to survive harsh conditions like river flooding and
                  drought and have maintained their names until nowadays. These
                  characteristics also make them a candidate for species used
                  for the restoration of rivers and wetlands.

                  This paper is about improving the probability of germination
                  to break seed dormancy. To improve the germination of the
                  Octopus leg, 60 tests were conducted at different temperatures
                  on night and day. It turned out that the best temperature for
                  germination was 23/7 ℃ and 95 percent of seeds were
                  germinated. One noticeable result from this experiment was the
                  greater the temperature difference between day and night the
                  better the germination rate. For smooth germination of Octopus
                  legs, the daily temperature difference had to be at least 15℃.
                  Also, gibberellin treatment helped to increase the germination
                  rate from 28 percent to 94 percent and shortened many days
                  (6.3 days) required for germination. These results will be
                  utilized as a basis for the use of Octopus legs and the
                  conservation of species diversity.
