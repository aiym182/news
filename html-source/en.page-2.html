                  A book has been published about the only Seed Vault in the
                  world that permanently stores wild plant seeds.

                  The Seed Vault, in preparation for ‘doomsday’, securely and
                  permanently stores wild plant seeds. There are currently only
                  two seed vault facilities in the world; Norway and South
                  Korea.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  The author of the book thoroughly explains the process from
                  how to collect the plant seeds to how to secure them at a low
                  temperature from their views.

                  The C.E.O. of the publisher, ‘Si-Wol’ says, “I decided to
                  publish this book in the hope of promoting the meaningful
                  stories of the space and the people at the Seed Vault. These
                  people at the facility have worked hard for our future
                  generations.”

                  Bae Gihwa, the director of the Seed Vault says, “this book is
                  very interesting because it contains stories about the Seed
                  Vault that have not been very well known to a lot of people.”
                  He also says that he will continue to create a variety of
                  interesting stories about the Seed Vault with the help of
                  professional authors.
