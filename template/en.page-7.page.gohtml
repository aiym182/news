                  its operation over the past five years, discussed the future
                  development directions, and came up with innovative mid, and
                  long-term plans for the future. These plans were discussed in
                  the direction of sharing past achievements and including
                  future improvements. In the past, the purpose of the Seed
                  Vault was to increase the amount of storage, but in the
                  future, the main focus was to target the qualitative growth of
                  stored seeds. With various related organizations, it included
                  methods for securing and storing seeds for each purpose. In
                  particular, it included content to prepare for a leap into the
                  Global Seed Vault by forming overseas Seed Vaults network base
                  regions such as Australia and Georgia.
